This is an experimental lab where you will make your own Arduino. It has never been tried before! Please help to build out the activity.

## In The Report
For the report, make a copy of this wiki page for your own repository, and then delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include snippets of code that explain what you did.

Deliverables are due next Tuesday. Post a link to the wiki page on your main class hub page.
