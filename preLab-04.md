For the upcoming labs, we will be building paper displays inspired by [Isaac Blankensmith](http://www.isaacblankensmith.com/) and [Smooth Technology's](https://smooth.technology) [Paper Signals](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/paper-signals) project (Lab 4) or building a paper jack in a box (Lab 5).

2. PAPER MECHANICS: [Paper prototyping](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/paper-prototyping-the-practical-beginners-guide/) is used by UX designers to quickly develop interface ideas and run them by people before any programming occurs. [Cardboard prototypes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_9Q-KDSb9o) help interactive product designers to work through additional issues, like how big something should be, how it could be carried, where it would sit. [Surprisingly complicated forms](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/50032245843343100/) can be built with paper, cardstock or cardboard. The most advanced and challenging prototypes to prototype with paper are [cardboard mechanisms](https://www.pinterest.com/helgangchin/paper-mechanisms/) which move and change.
