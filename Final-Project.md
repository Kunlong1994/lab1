## Objective

The goal of this final project is for you to have a fully functioning and well-designed interactive device of your own design.
 
## Description
Your project is to design and build an interactive device to suit a specific application of your choosing. 

To this end, you will:

1.  articulate, through interaction diagrams, interface sketches, and written descriptions, exactly what it is you are proposing to build, and to enumerate what some of the design challenges that you foresee. 

2. You should plan on building multiple working iterations of your design to enable increasing levels of refinement towards your point of view. 

3. You should plan on housing/packaging/installing your device in ways that consider the context, use and user. 

4. Also, you are expected to do enough project planning hoping that all the different aspects of the design will miraculously come together just in time for the final presentations.

## Project Madness

For October 31, you should prepare a short (we have 50-ish people in the class! so ~1 minute) pitch/sketch/skit of your provisional project idea. The teaching team will suspend judgement of all ideas and provide guidance for scoping the project afterwards, via Discord. The main point of this madness pitch is to recruit like-minded or interested collaborators, so the teaching team fully expects most of the ideas presented here to be abandoned or substantively changed.

## Paper Prototype

For the paper prototype fair on November 7, you should bring a paper prototype of your project to class.

In addition, we expect you to have a GitHub repository for your final project, and to have this listed and linked to the course Github Readme.md. In your project's README.md file, you should list:

- Project Idea
- Team
- Rough form: this is your paper prototype (put photos on your GitHub, bring the actual thing to class)
- Expected parts: is there a display, a motor, batters, interface, etc? Where does the Pi/Arduino/other controller go?
- Interaction plan: how will people interact with your device?

## Presentation

We will be having in-class progress presentations on November 14th; please plan on presenting a functional prototype and a list of what remains to be done on that date.

Functional check off will be done December 5th.
 
For final presentations on December 10th, do think ahead about what you might need (poster, power cords, speakers, a backdrop to set the scenario of use, etc.) to quickly convey the merits of your design to passersby!
 
## Documentation

Plan to host documentation of the projects on Github You should set up your own page, and need, at a minimum, to post your design point of view (what are you designing the interactive device for), photos of your paper prototype, your state diagrams, your project code, and a video of the final working player _in use_.

## Evaluation

Evaluation of this project will be based in equal measure on assessment of:
* Your design (_Was it a good plan?_)
* Its execution (_Did you do a good job building what you intended?_)
* Its fit to your point of view (_Does it fulfill the intended purpose well?_)
* Your process (_Did you allocate your time and resources well? e.g. Did stuff happen on schedule?_)
* Your documentation (_Can someone learn how to do what you did?_)
