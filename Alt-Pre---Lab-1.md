1. Set up your Github class "Hub" repository by [following these instructions](https://github.com/jdz32/github-guide/blob/master/README.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository and [learn how](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to post links to your submissions on your readme.md so we can find them easily.
3. Locate electronics which you can hack for the Light It Up lab on Thursday. 
4. Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) on your laptop. 
5. Read through Lab 1.
7. Solder header pins onto Adafruit Metro Mini (See PartA of lab1, tutorial for soldering : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3230nCz3XQA)


Reading
* Circuits & Basic Electronics Review: Scherz, Ch 2.1-2.17, Ch. 3.1-3.5
* Arduino basics: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Foundations

For class, remember to bring:
1. Your laptop
2. Your device-to-be-hacked
3. Whatever dongle you need to hook up a USB device to your laptop

For the upcoming lab, we will be building digital timers.

1. SOLDERING REVIEW: You will be soldering together your 16x2 LCD display ([wiki](http://wiki.sunfounder.cc/index.php?title=LCD1602_Module#Pins_Functions)) so here is a quick set of videos from NASA showing how to solder: https://radiojove.gsfc.nasa.gov/telescope/soldering.htm

2. DESIGN READING: This is intended to help you understand what it means to design interactive devices, and to understand how to  "sketch interactions": Bill Moggridge, Designing Interactions, [Chapter 1](http://www.designinginteractions.com/downloads/DesigningInteractions_1.pdf) & Bill Verplank [Interaction Design Sketchbook](http://billverplank.com/CiiD/IDSketch.pdf) <== focus on section starting on page 10!

3. ELECTRONICS READING: Scherz Chapter 13 (Microcontrollers), 

3. IDEA GENERATION: The point of this week's lab is to figure out a cool interaction that you can make possible with the timer capabilities of the micro controller.  You could make a game where people have to try to press a button more times than their friend in a certain amount of time. You could make something that sings you to sleep, and gets quieter and quieter over 3 minutes. You could make something that you hit as you start to run down a hall, and then hit again, to see how fast you can run. 

Please come up with 10 ideas of what you could do. They *do not* need to be potential market blockbusters. They *do* need to be things you feel like doing next week. You will also be asked to film one of your classmates trying out your idea, so pick things one of your classmates will be comfortable doing on film. Draw sketches with each of your ideas.
