Instructions for Mac

Plug an ethernet cable from your Mac to the Raspberry Pi (note you may need to use a Thunderbolt to Ethernet or USB to Ethernet adapter if your Mac does not have a built in Ethernet port).

Check that the IxE are getting a self assigned IP in System Preferences -> Network. It should have an orange color.

Try pinging your IxE with the .local extension: ping ixe05.local

If the ping work, you can ssh in just like normal.
