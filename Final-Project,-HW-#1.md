# Setting up your project GitHub

To submit your final project, and to help us keep track of your progress, please make sure you have a single GitHub repository for it. 

GitHub allows you to add collaborators to a projects, so your whole team (if you have one) can contribute and make changes to your shared repository.

As of now, your repository should include, at a minimum:

- Project Idea
- Team
- Rough form: this is your paper prototype (put photos up on GitHub)
- Expected parts: is there a display, a motor, batters, interface, etc? Where does the Pi/Arduino/other controller go?
- Interaction plan: how will people interact with your device?

## Add a link to the student spreadsheet

Once you've created your project repository, update [this student spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jj1k6TqVeYlY_HoPcCLTnNt2-maIJkDGyz53OstApOA/edit) with your project title, a link to the GitHub repository, and a list of your teammates' NetIDs.
