For next week's lab, we'll be making useless boxes. For the lab, we'll have readymade files for you to customize and laser cut. However, we'd like you to take a moment to think about how to make a box with a hinged lid. So take a look at this [useless box example](https://makezine.com/projects/the-most-useless-machine/) and try to create one out of paper in less than 30 minutes. Submit a picture of your paper prototype! Bonus points if you submit a timelapse of the process.
