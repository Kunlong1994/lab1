**Cat** - prints out what is in a file. ``cat example.js``

**Nano** - opens any program/text file and then allows you to edit the file. ``nano example.js`` Look at the bottom of the screen to see the commands to control the editor. (^) means control. Example: ^X means control+X which will exit the text editor. 

**Python** - execute python programs. ``python example.py``

**Node** - similar to the python command, BUT it executes javascript programs INSTEAD. ``node example.js``
