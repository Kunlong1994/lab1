For this week’s lab, we want you to experiment with digital fabrication tools. The methods that will be used are 3D printing and laser cutting.  

## 3D printing
3. Complete the first [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) tutorial. You’ll need to create an account.
4. Create a new project (outside the tutorial file) and make a cylinder 5mm tall and 6.9mm that you’ll use as your button.
5. Personalize the button to make it your own.
6. Export the object as an `.stl` file.
7. Download and install the [Makerbot Print](https://www.makerbot.com/print/)
8. Create a MakerBot account.
9. Start the Makerbot Print Application and log in.
10. Load the exported `.stl` button into the printer.
11. Connect your laptop to the printer over USB.
12. Once the Printer is connected hit "print".
13. After the printer has started the USB cable can be disconnected from your laptop.

## Laser cutting
1. Make sure you have followed the safety instructions from Niti.
2. Download a vector editing program like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) or [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) if you have access to Adobe Creative Cloud.
3. Download the laser cut file for the [CameraButtonStand](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/master/CameraButtonStand.svg)
4. Try to understand how these cuts lead to the 3D object.

5. Personalize the stand to make it your own.
6. Save the file -> move it to a USB drive-> connected it to the laser cutting computer.
7.  Open the file in Adobe Illustrator on the lab’s computer.
8.  Set the line-width to 0.001pt.
9.  Follow the instructions to cut:
    10.  Load the machine with 4 millimetre cardboard.
    11.  Disable X/Y.
    12.  Move the laser to its starting position(top left corner of the material.
    12.  Focus the laser.(Don't forget to put the focus tool up again!)
    13.  Set home(button).
    14.  Close the lid.
    14.  Open the printer preferences.
    14.  Make sure you set the different power levels for the normal cut and blue scoring-cut. See for values below.
    15.  Turn on the air assist compressor on the floor and the suction system (big blue box).
    16.  Print the job.
    17.  Press go on the laser cutter.

# LAB SUBMISSION (Due befor the lecture on Tue: 2/27/2018):
Post your files to GitHub; make sure to include at least one photo of your final object. Consider using the light box in the MakerLab to take high-quality product pictures.

Post a link to your GitHub submission on your Slack channel, cross post to the #lab3 channel, and tag the TAs with questions/requests for feedback.
