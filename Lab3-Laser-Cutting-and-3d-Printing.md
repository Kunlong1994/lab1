For this weeks lab, we want you to experiment with digital fabrication tools. The methods that will be used are 3D printing and Laser Cutting.  

## 3d Printing 
1. Create an [Autodesk account](https://accounts.autodesk.com/register)
2. Login to [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/)
3. Follow the first tutorial to get used to the Tinkercad interface.
4. Create a new project and make a cylinder 5mm high and 6.9mm diameter. This will be your button.
5. Personalise the button top with letters or signs - if you'd like.
6. Export the object as an `.stl` file.
7. Download and install the [Makerbot Print](https://www.makerbot.com/print/)
8. Create a MakerBot account.
9. Start the Makerbot Print Application and log in. 
10. Load the exported `.stl` button into the printer. 
11. Connect the printer over USB.
12. Once the Printer is connected hit print. 
13. After the printer has started the USB cable can be disconnected.

## Laser cutting
1. Make sure you have followed the safety instructions from Niti
2. Download a vector editing program like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) or [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) if you have access to the Creative Cloud. 
3. Download the laser cut file for the [CameraButtonStand](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/master/CameraButtonStand.svg) 
4. Try to understand how these cuts lead to the 3D object.
5. Personalise the stand - if you'd like.
6. Save the file move it to a USB drive, connected it to the laser cutting computer.
7.  Open the file in Adobe Illustrator on that computer. 
8.  Set the line-width to 0.001pt.
9.  Follow the instructions to cut the stand.
10.  Make sure you color code it correctly.
