# Useless Box

For this week’s lab, we will be building a useless box; this is a project inspired by [Make Magazine](https://makezine.com/projects/the-most-useless-machine/), which you used as reference for the preLab, and a [similar lab](https://web.stanford.edu/class/engr40m/labs/lab2a.pdf) at Stanford's [ENGR40m](https://web.stanford.edu/class/engr40m/). We will use this lab to help you to experiment with digital fabrication tools. The methods that will be used are 3D printing and laser cutting.  

## 3D printing

3D print this [servo mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1926568).

1. Export the object as a `.stl` file.
1. Download and install [Makerbot Print](https://www.makerbot.com/print/).
1. Create a MakerBot account.
1. Start the Makerbot Print Application and log in.
1. Load the exported `.stl` button into the printer.
1. Connect your laptop to the printer over USB.
1. Once the Printer is connected hit "print".
1. After the printer has started the USB cable can be disconnected from your laptop.

BONUS:
Modify the servo mount. 
1. Create an account using your student email (so that it's free).
1. Take a tutorial to learn how to use OnShape.
1. Import the servo mount and modify it to make it your own. 


## Laser cutting -- Andrea will edit these instructions

Laser cut the box in the Maker Lab. 

1. Make sure you have followed the safety instructions from Niti.
2. Download a vector editing program like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) (free) or [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) (free for 30 day trial).
3. Open the laser cutter template file for the [Useless Box](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/wiki/uselessbox.ai) in your vector editing program.

5. Modify the vector drawing as you please. BONUS: experiment with etching.
7.  Open the file in Adobe Illustrator on the lab’s computer.
8.  Set the line-width to 0.001pt.

9.  Follow the instructions to cut:
    * Load the machine with the 5/32" thick cardboard we provided. If the material is bent, tape the ends using duct tape to the sides of the printing bed to make it as flat as possible.
    * Disable X/Y.
    *  Move the laser to its starting position(top left corner of the material.
    *  Focus the laser. (Don't forget to put the focus tool up again!)
    *  Set home(button).
    *  Close the lid.
    *   Open the printer preferences.
    *   Make sure you set the different power levels for the cut values pertaining to the material you're using. For the cardboard we are providing, the settings should be the following: Speed 45%, Power 70%, and Frequency: 500Hz.
    *   Turn on the air assist compressor on the floor and the suction system (big blue box).
    *   Print the job.
    *   Press 'go' on the laser cutter.



An option for the finger:
6. Now that you know how to use the laser cutter, draw something on the vector software to use a the "finger" — there is a lot of cool scrap materials, like acrylics that will work well for this. Make sure to adjust the speed, power, and frequency settings for the material you decide to use.   

## Electronics --
Create this circuit. [Include diagram with switch, servo, 9V battery, and Arduino]. 
Bonus: use a prototoboard instead of a breadboard.

## Putting it all together --
Assemble your useless box. So that it works like this: show video.

# LAB SUBMISSION (Due before the lecture on Tue: 2/27/2018):
Post your files to GitHub. Make sure to include at least one video of your final object. Consider using the lightbox in the MakerLab to take high-quality product footage and images.
[[images/lightBox.jpg|alt=Image of a light box used to make evenly lit pictures of products and designs.]]  
Post a link to your GitHub submission on your Slack channel with your photo, cross post to the #lab3 channel, and tag the TAs with questions/requests for feedback.
