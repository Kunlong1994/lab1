In preparation for this week's lab, you'll build a small circuit with your Arduino and test it with some code.

### Button Circuit

On your breadboard, make this [basic button circuit](#basic-button-circuit) connected to `pin 2` of the Arduino. (The LED is built in on the board and connected to `pin 13`.)

### Upload the `HelloYou` code

Copy the [HelloYou](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/interaction-engine/blob/master/helloYouSketch.ino) sketch into a new Arduino window and upload it to your board.

The built-in LED marked `L` should be off.

Open the Serial Monitor in Arduino and observe what happens when you press the button in your circuit -- you should see a change!
