In preparation for Lab 6, you need to:

1) Make sure your laptop can get on [RedRover](https://it.cornell.edu/topic/redrover-wi-fi).

2) Skim the chapter on [The Interaction Engine](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2019Fall/readings/Martelaro2018_Chapter_TheInteractionEngine.pdf)

3) If you are new to the command line, review this [Unix command cheatsheet](http://cheatsheetworld.com/programming/unix-linux-cheat-sheet/) and use Terminal or PuTTY (or whatever Leif recommends) to get ready to use the Pi.

4) Ask any questions you have about Raspberry Pis in general on the Discord channel.

5) Pre-read [Lab 6 directions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/wiki/Lab-06).

6) Browse [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com) libraries for possible fun features to add to Lab 6.
