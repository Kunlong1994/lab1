# Make an Etch-a-Sketch! 
 
## Overview
This week's project integrates continuous data from the Arduino to enable an electronic [Etch-a-Sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLtzUdLywuo) interface.
 
### In The Report
Include your responses to the **bold** questions, and include snippets of code that explain what you did. Embed a video demo of your Etch-a-sketch and follow-on design.
 
### Parts

 
## Part A. Node Canvas
This week's lab is based on the following Node.js code that creates a canvas for drawing: http://wesbos.com/html5-canvas-websockets-nodejs/
 
Set up the IxE to serve the client.js  client, and to run this server.js code.

Fork [this example project](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/etch-a-sketch) to your own repository by clicking the fork button on the top right.

GitHub will make a copy for you on which you can work.

After logging in to your Ice over ssh. You can now go ahead and `clone` __your forked version__ of the Etch a Sketch example. Adapt the following example with your name

```shell
git clone https://github.com/**_YourGITRepoName_**/etch-a-sketch
```
This command will download a copy of your repository to your IxE. 
Don't forget to use `git add .`, `git commit -m 'message'` and `git push` to update your code to the GitHub. If this is unclear have a look at the [GitHub Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf).

1. **Where in this code does the drawing occur?**
1. **What are the inputs to the drawing function?**
1. **How can the screen be cleared?**

## Part B. Etch a Sketch
Use any combination of input sensors and switches with the Node Canvas to create your own unique Etch a Sketch.  You are welcome to make as liberal an interpretation of the Etch a Sketch concept as you like, as long as you:
 
- Allow a user to control the creation of a drawing
- Give users real-time feedback of what the user is drawing
- Make it possible to clear a drawing

1. **Describe which sensors you are using as inputs and why.**
1. **In what format does the server expect the X & Y values from the Arduino?**
1. **What else does the Arduino need to do? The sensorCode folder has an almost working example.**
1. **What range of output X & Y values do you need? Is it better to map the values from the inputs to the outputs in the Arduino code, the Node code or Client code ? Why?**
1. **How often do you need to be sending data from the Arduino?**
1. **Include a copy of the Arduino code, and a copy of your Server and client side code.**

## Part C. Make it yours
Add a feature. (If you're working in a group, add as many features as you have people in your group.)

For example, make it possible to save a drawing, or make it possible to recall a drawing after it has been cleared from the screen. Or make a multi-player Etch-a-sketch.

1. **Upload video of your Etch-a-Sketch in action, being used by someone else in the class!**
