# Make an Etch-a-Sketch! 
 
## Overview
This week's project integrates continuous data from the Arduino to enable an electronic [Etch-a-Sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLtzUdLywuo) interface.
 
### In The Report
Include your responses to the **bold** questions, and include snippets of code that explain what you did. Embed a video demo of your Etch-a-sketch and follow-on design.
 
### Parts

 
## Part A. Node Canvas
This week's lab is based on the following Node.js code that creates a canvas for drawing: http://wesbos.com/html5-canvas-websockets-nodejs/
 
Set up the IxE to serve the Client.js  client, and to run this Server.js code by forking and cloning [etch-a-sketch example](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/etch-a-sketch).
**
1. Where in this code does the drawing occur?
1. What are the inputs to the drawing function?
1. How can the screen be cleared?
**

## Part B. Etch a Sketch
Use any combination of input sensors and switches with the Graphical LCD  to create your own unique Etch a Sketch. You are welcome to make as liberal an interpretation of the Etch a Sketch concept as you like, as long as you:
 
- Allow a user to control the creation of a drawing
- Give users real-time feedback of what the user is drawing
- Make it possible to clear a drawing
**
1. Describe which sensors you are using as inputs and why.
1. What range of output X & Y values do you need? Is it better to map the values from the inputs to the outputs in the Arduino code or the Node code? Why?
1. How often do you need to be sending data from the Arduino?
1. Include a copy of the Arduino code, and a copy of your Server and client side code.
**

## Part C. Make it yours
Add a feature. 

For example, make it possible to save a drawing, or make it possible to recall a drawing after it has been cleared from the screen. Or make a multi-player Etch-a-sketch.
**
1. Upload video of your Etch-a-Sketch in action, being used by someone else in the class!**
